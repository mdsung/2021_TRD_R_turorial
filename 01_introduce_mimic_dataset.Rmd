* **Core**: 
  The core module contains patient tracking data. Demographics, hospital admissions, and in-hospital ward transfers are described here.

* **Hosp**:
  The Hosp module provides all data acquired from the hospital wide electronic health record. Information covered includes laboratory measurements, microbiology, medication administration, and billed diagnoses.

* **ICU**:
  The ICU module contains information collected from the clinical information system used within the ICU. Documented data includes intravenous administrations, ventilator settings, and other charted items.

* **CXR**:
  The CXR module provides lookup tables linking patient identifiers with MIMIC-CXR study_id and dicom_id, allowing analysis of patient chest x-rays with the associated clinical data.
